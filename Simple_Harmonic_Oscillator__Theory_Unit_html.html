         Where, τ = Torque ; I = Moment of Inertia; α = Angular Velocity. m is mass of the oscillator, l is the length of the oscillator and theta is initial displacement. The above equation can be rearranged as -

If the amplitude of  angular displacement is small then we can use the approximation (sinθ ≈ θ). By considering the above approximation, the equation of motion reduces to :
