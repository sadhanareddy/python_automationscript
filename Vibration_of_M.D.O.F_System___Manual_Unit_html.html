<strong>Observation 1:</strong> Finding natural frequencies and mode shapes <br/><br/>

1. Take n storey structure. <br/>
2. Input mass and stiffness of each storey <br/>
3. Run the experiment. User can see eigen values (natural frequencies) and eigen vectors (mode shapes). <br/>
4. Use may note the eigen vectors and check for modal orthogonality. <br/><br/>
<strong>Observation 2:</strong> Find the response of the structure to given ground motion. <br/><br/>

5. Take n storey structure. <br/>
6. Input mass and stiffness of each storey.<br/> 
7. Select ground motion and also damping. <br/>
8. Run the experiment. User can find the response of the each floor level on the screen. User can also find the response of each mode. <br/>
