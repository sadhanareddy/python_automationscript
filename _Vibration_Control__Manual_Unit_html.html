Start the experiment with the default values of mass and stiffness of the structure, and default values of mass and stiffness of Tuned mass damper(TMD). Observe how structure is vibrating due to external loads. <br/><br/>
<strong>Observation 1:</strong> Experiment starts with default mass and stiffness of structure. User can change the values of mass and stiffness of TMD. Observe how structure is vibrating due to external loads with TMD and without TMD.<br/><br/>
<strong>Observation 2:</strong> In this stage, user can change mass and stiffness of structure as well as mass and stiffness of TMD. User can also change the damping value of TMD and earthquake data. Observe how structure is vibrating due to external loads with TMD and without TMD.<br/>
