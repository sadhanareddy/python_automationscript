(a)  To design transistor level schematic of an Inverter using

        * Complementary CMOS logic
        * Pseudo NMOS logic
<br/>
(b)  To find the effect of load capacitance on the rise time and fall time and hence delay of output waveform.
<br/>

(c)  To find the effect of W/L of transistors on the output waveform.
