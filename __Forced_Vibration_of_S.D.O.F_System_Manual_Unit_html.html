<strong>Observation 1:</strong> Effect of time period on maximum response<br/><br/>

1. Run the experiment with default ground motion and building parameters <br/>
2. Observe the response and note down the maximum response. <br/>
3. Repeat the experiment by changing the values of mass of the structure. (Note: Change in mass will change the time period of the structure) <br/>
4. Note the maximum response.<br/>
5. Plot the graph between the maximum response and the time period of the structure.<br/><br/>
<strong>Observation 2:</strong> Effect of resonance without damping <br/><br/>

6. Select Resonance from the list of earthquakes. And set damping to Zero<br/>
7. Run the experiment and note the displacement.<br/>
8. Response value increases and reaches peak when forcing frequency is nearing natural frequency of the structure.<br/>
9. Draw the plot between maximum response and frequency ratio. <br/>
