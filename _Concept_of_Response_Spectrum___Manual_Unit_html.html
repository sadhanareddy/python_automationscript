<strong>Observation 1:</strong> Concept of response spectrum <br/>
There are 3 buildings shown on the screen. User can select mass and stiffness of all 3 buildings. However, user need to make sure that at least two buildings time period is same.<br/>
Select the earthquake ground motion record and also damping.<br/>
Run the experiment.<br/>
You will observe after completing that the maximum displacement of the oscillators with same time period is same irrespective of their different masses and stiffnesses.<br/>
