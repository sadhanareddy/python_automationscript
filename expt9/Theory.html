<!-- <h3>THEORY </h3><br> -->
</p><p>The physical mask layout of any circuit to be manufactured using a particular process must conform to a set of geometric constraints or rules, which are generally called layout design rules. These rules usually specify the minimum allowable line widths for physical objects on-chip such as metal and polysilicon interconnects or diffusion areas, minimum feature dimensions, and minimum allowable separations between two such features. If a metal line width is made too small, for example, it is possible for the line to break during the fabrication process or afterwards, resulting in an open circuit. If two lines are placed too close to each other in the layout, they may form an unwanted short circuit by merging during or after the fabrication process. The main objective of design rules is to achieve a high overall yield and reliability while using the smallest possible silicon area, for any circuit to be manufactured with a particular process. 
	</p><br/>
<p>We can say, in general, that observing the layout design rules significantly increases the probability of fabricating a successful product with high yield.</p><br/>
<ul>
<li>The design rules are usually described in two ways :</li><br/><br/>
<li>Micron rules, in which the layout constraints such as minimum feature sizes and minimum allowable feature separations, are stated in terms of absolute dimensions in micrometers, or,</li>
<li>Lambda rules, which specify the layout constraints in terms of a single parameter Lambda  and, thus, allow linear, proportional scaling of all geometrical constraints.</li>
</ul>
