          Forced vibration is of two types:<br/>
1. undamped forced vibration<br/>
2. damped forced vibration <br/>
<strong>Undamped forced vibration :</strong> 

The differential governing equation for system without damping is 
mü + ku = posinωt <br/>
where, m = mass;   ü = acceleration;   k = stiffness;   u = displacement;   ωn= natural frequency;   po= amplitude of force. <br/>  
Solution of the given equation is <br/>
